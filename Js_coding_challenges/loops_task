Write a for loop that iterates through our vacationSpots array using i as the iterator variable.

Inside the block of the for loop, use console.log() to log each element in the
vacationSpots array after the string 'I would love to visit '. For example,
the first round of the loop should print 'I would love to visit Bali' to the
console.
